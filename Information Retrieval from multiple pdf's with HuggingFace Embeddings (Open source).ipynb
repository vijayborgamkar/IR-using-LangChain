As shown by previous research, GPS-tagged Twitter data enables the prediction of future crimes in a major city, Chicago, Illinois, of the United States. However, existing crime prediction models that incorporate data from Twitter have limitations in describing criminal incidents due to the absence of sentiment polarity and weather factors. The addition of sentiment analysis and weather predictors to such models would deliver significant insight about how crime. Our aim is to predict the time and location in which a specific type of crime will occur. Our approach is based on sentiment analysis by applying lexicon-based methods and understanding of categorized weather data, combined with kernel density estimation based on historical crime incidents and prediction via linear modeling. By testing our model’s ability to predict future crime on each area of the city, we observed that the model surpassed the benchmark model, which predicts crime incidents using kernel density estimation.  Index Terms - Crime prediction, Kernel density estimation, Twitter sentiment analysis, Weather INTRODUCTION Automatic crime prediction is a key technique used to identify the optimal patrol strategies for police departments. In order to maximize the allocation of scarce resources, advancements in crime prediction are required. However, conventional crime prediction techniques have some drawbacks in capturing crime incidents due to the lack of criminal predictive factors in the statistical model. There are multiple factors that could affect future crime incidents other than crime hot spots. Nevertheless, a deeper investigation of criminology is necessary for selecting the possible contributing factors for crime incidents. The conventional crime predictive models are lacking in two specific areas of study. First, they ignore the sentiment of social media content. Secondly, the models do not consider the environmental conditions of incidents of interest. Social media content has rich contextual information about its users’ daily activities based on posted textual data. Each textual post is compiled to the platform of service providers. These threads or posts generate an unstructured form of data. Therefore, data generated by social media can be considered as a strong tool for crime prediction. To develop the advanced crime prediction model, we select Twitter to supply data. Previous research has been established on using Twitter data and our work is the extension of these previous works.  In addition to Twitter data, we considered weather factors as the environmental factors that may affect the occurrence of criminal incidents. Weather factors, especially temperature, were discovered to be one of the significantly influential factors that lead a person to have aggressive behaviors. Anderson investigated crime incidents in two major cities to track the correlation between temperature and the frequency of violent crimes. In his paper, the incidence of violent crime has positive linear relationship with temperature of the day [1]. We collected Twitter data from official Twitter Streaming API. Along with the Twitter data, we also obtained weather data from the Weather Underground website to build a crime prediction model that has sentiment polarity and weather factors to make an accurate prediction on crime incidents using linear modeling.  PROBLEM STATEMENT Automatic crime prediction is one of strongest tools for maximizing the allocation for scarce resources for preventing crime. However, conventional crime prediction models that employ Twitter data have limitations on describing the real time reflection of criminal incidents. Polarities of sentiment and possible weather factors have the ability to improve the accuracy and maximize the predictive power of crime models. In order to achieve our goal, we set four objectives: (1) to analyze textual content in Twitter data by using sentiment analysis to score the positivity/negativity of tweets and their trends in different neighborhoods. (2) to identify the weather factors that serve as significant indicators to predict certain crime incidents. (3) to employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to derive the distribution of crime incidents in the Chicago area. (4) to build and evaluate the predictive model by adding Twitter-derived data and weather factors to criminal incident data. RELATED WORK I. Crime Forecasting Using Weather Data The past studies of aggressive behavior on an uncomfortable days demonstrated clear correlations between weather and criminal activities.

       " Document(page_content='predicted that violent crimes would be more prevalent during the hotter quarters of the year and in hotter years [2]. From the psychological aspect of the human being as a decision maker, the designated actor would not respond to certain situations logically. In fact, the actor would act irrationally, affected and controlled by his surroundings. The previous studies that discuss the relationship between crime incidents and weather factors only used statistical inference approach. The studies are more focused on how independent variables, such as temperature, humidity, and other weather factors, contribute to crime incidents, reporting how an increased or decreased range of each factor related to the type of crime that increased or decreased. Previous studies of weather and crime incidents relationship model only focused on singular weather factors, but rarely treated weather factors as a set of explanatory variables. II. Sentiment Analysis The rapid growth in the volume of users in social network services has provided the predictive ability in extensive fields, in which allow us to predict the reaction in selected public groups. Examples of predictive modeling based on social media contents are election results [3], the box office performance of movies [4], product sales [5], and stock market trends [6]. These researches primarily use the technique of sentiment analysis. Researchers employ semantic analysis on the contextual contents of each tweet and draw the predictive response of the selected group of people. However, the previous researches are deficient in the prediction model for a wild range of population. These studies only collected data from selected groups of people to predict their future response in certain circumstances. This limited information based on certain groups of people does not portray the overall response towards criminal incidents.  Since other research studies have addressed limitations on representing the response of the population to criminal incidents, we approached from another angle to reduce the restricted predictive information regarding the selectiveness of people. Other researchers developed criminal prediction models using topic modeling on Twitter data. Previous study of Wang et al only focused on the tweets from new agencies to find the correlation between topics, which used in the tweets, and specific types of criminal incidents [7]. Gerber et al, further developed the prediction model via topic modeling [8]. He combined historical crime incidents with GPS-tagged Twitter data, which was collected from all twitter users within the Chicago city area. However, these models only considered topic modeling, but did not apply sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Meanwhile, they also did not explore weather factors. These factors may have influence on crime in combination with Twitter messages. In our study, we addressed these limitations. We applied sentiment analysis to evaluate the polarity of tweets. We also integrated weather factors into the model with sentiment polarity and historical crime record as explanatory variables. Taking full advantage of all these features, we are able to develop more accurate prediction on future crime incidents. DATA COLLECTION The primary data source that we used for making a crime predictive model was Twitter data. We utilized tweets with GPS coordinates, which were generated within the Chicago city boundary from January 1st, 2014 to Jan 31st, 2014 (n=1069804). The twitter posts we used came from the official Twitter streaming API, bounded with coordinates [-87.94, 41.64] (South-West limit) and [-87.52, 42.02] (North-East limit) [9]. Figure 1 shows a kernel density estimation plot for tweets generated within the Chicago city boundary during the time period. In addition to Twitter data, Chicago criminal incidents data shows the historical trends of theft incidents occurred in Chicago. This data originated from the Chicago data portal website, which was developed by the Chicago Police Department by tracking theft incidents committed on spatial points indicated with specific latitude and longitude, and the time of the theft incidents [10]. These historical theft records within the boundary of the Chicago are from December 25th, 2013 to January 31st, 2014. The data contains 5395 theft incidents points. The last data we utilized was weather data. We collected this data from Weather Underground, which is one of the web sites that provide the history of weather forecast and the future forecast for Chicago [11]. The weather data contains information including minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures in Fahrenheit; dew point in Fahrenheit; humidity in %; sea level pressure in Inches; visibility per Miles; wind speed in Mph; cloud cover indicated by 1 to 8; and events. Events give us information about sunny, rain, snow, and fog events on daily basis.  \\n FIGURE 1 KDE FOR GPS-TAGGED TWEETS THAT ORIGINATED WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF CHICAGO BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2014 AND JANUARY 31, 2014 MODELING To construct our crime prediction model, we first determine the training set of theft density, Twitter data, and weather 2015 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium\\n978-1-4799-1832-4/15/$31.00 (c) 2015, IEEE 64 Authorized licensed use limited to: BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE.

       " Document(page_content='data for 6-hour intervals in a day. This data contains the locations of occurrence in latitudes and longitude. From these geo-spatial points, we gained information on whether the designated regions have crime within 200-meter square. To begin sectioning the regional space across Chicago, we separate the Chicago area into multitude of smaller regional sectors that have length of 200 meter by 200 meter. Assigning all the crime points to the smaller sectors (neighborhoods) that we created a set of binary classifiers (crime or non-crime). After assigning binary classifiers to the designated regional sectors containing either crime points or no crime point, we computed polarity scores for each tweet within the boundary of Chicago. The scoring process is explained in the later work section below. Besides Twitter data, we modified weather data into an appropriate format. Each 6 hours, we assigned some of weather factors including temperatures and dew points, into 6-hour periods. For the time period between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., we assigned minimum temperatures and dew points from our original raw data, and for the time period between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m., maximum temperatures and dew points were assigned. Except for these two specific time periods, we assigned mean values of temperature and dew points to the other time periods. Next, combining weather, twitter polarity score and its trend, we determined the explanatory variables in our training set as described below.  Response variable yt(p) = (0 = non-crime points, 1= crime points) Explanatory variable x1,t(p) = Crime density x2,t(p) = Polarity score of tweets (-1 to 1) x3,t(p) = 3 –day Trend of polarity score x4,t(p) = Temperature (Fahrenheit) x5,t(p) = Dew points (Fahrenheit) x6,t(p) = Mean humidity (%) x7,t(p) = Mean sea level pressure (Inch) x8,t(p) =  Mean wind speed (MPH) x9,t(p) = Precipitation (Inch) x10,t(p) =  Cloud cover (1 to 8) x11,t(p) = Events (Sunny, Rain, Snow, Fog) I. Kernel Density Estimation Our crime densities for theft incidents were computed by KDE at a point p. The computational equation of KDE is following,   !!x1,t(p)=k(p,h)=1PhKj=1P∑||p−pj||h⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟             (1)  In this equation, we calculate crime density at each point of p. In additional to the crime point of p, we set h as the bandwidth parameter that manages the smoothness of the KDE The capital letter P in our equation is the total number of crime incidents of theft that occurred in Chicago during the 6-hour periods in a day, j indicates a single crime point from the data of a time period, K is the standard normal density function, and ! ||i|| is the Euclidean norm. pj is the actual crime point of theft in Chicago. We utilized the ks package in R statistical program to determine k(p,h), and we also utilized the Hpi function for estimating bandwidth to acquire the value of h. This set of work is popularly utilized to estimate crime densities [12]. In our training theft density of KDE, we used 7 days (28 6-hour periods) of prior density to compute each KDE density for a specific date during the one-month period of data. II. Information from Twitter Messages The originality of this research lies in the combination of traditional kernel density estimate and weather features that describe the sentiment polarity and its trend of point p using Twitter content. We defined spatial sectors (neighborhoods) in Chicago by laying down evenly spaced cells 1000 meters on each side. Figure 2 below shows neighborhood sectors of 1000 meters by 1000 meters.  \\n FIGURE 2 NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARIES FOR COMPUTING THE SENTIMENT POLARITY OF TWEETS  Given the neighborhood defined above, the problem becomes the estimation of the sentiment polarity values for each neighborhood given the tweets posted by users in each neighborhood during different 6-hour period of a day. We used a sentiment lexicon dictionary [13] and `polarity` function for this purpose.  In the polarity function, a context cluster of words is pulled from around a polarized word to be used as variant shifters. Each word in this context was labeled in four different categories including neutral, negator, amplifier, and de-amplifier. Each polarized word in each document was then calculated based on the scores of polarity. In order to compute the polarity, we assigned scores for words using the lexicon dictionary [13]. Words with negative connotations were assigned negative polarity scores, and words with positive connotations were scored as positive. After evaluating polarity scores of the documents, we then utilized amplifiers or de-amplifiers (default is .8, de-amplifier weight is constrained to -1 lower bound) to re-2015 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium\\n978-1-4799-1832-4/15/$31.00 (c) 2015, IEEE 65 Authorized licensed use limited to: BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE.

       " Document(page_content='weight the polarity score of each document. Finally, with the context cluster of words are cited, we divided them by the square root of the number of words in each document, which produced the polarity score for each document [14]. Furthermore, we paid attention to emoticons, since they might contain important information about the emotional states of users. In order to appropriately tokenize commonly used emoticons, we used the plyrDictionary package in R to replace emoticons with English words within the lexicon dictionary. Besides sentiment polarity, we were also interested in the trend of sentiment within each neighborhood. Intuitively, consecutive periods of positive/negative sentiment might cause a higher risk of crime. In order to measure the trend, we created a trend index x3,t(p). The inspiration of the algorithm comes from the evaluation of the trend of stock prices [15]. The index we created can measure the previews k periods trend of polarity. Firstly, let yi be the percentage change of between previews k periods’ polarity and today’s polarity:  !!Vi=Pi−j−PiPi⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪⎫⎬⎪⎭⎪j=1k                                               (2)  Then, get the sum of the change over 10% a periods as an index x3,t(p) for trend:  !!Ti=v∈Vi:v>10%∪v<10%{}v∑       (3)  Positive T signifies that the polarity of previews periods is bigger than today; while negative T means the polarity of previews periods is smaller than current period. III. Logistic Regression Our goal was to use the weather and sentiment feature we mentioned above to make predictions about future theft incidents. Specifically, we set a binary random variable yt+1(p) to indicate whether crime incidents will occur in the next 6-hour period in the p neighborhood. Meanwhile, we derived a full model from logistic regression (4) by setting explanatory variables as we mentioned above.  !!logPryt+1(p)=1⎡⎣⎤⎦1−Pryt+1(p)=1⎡⎣⎤⎦⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟=β0+β1xt,1(p)+⋅⋅⋅+β11xt,11(p)  (4)  Where parameter {β0,..., β11} can be estimated by maximum likelihood function using historical theft incidents. For the prediction, we first calculated the estimated crime density of each neighborhood p on the period t′ by using the KDE method we mentioned above. Then we processed tweets on the period t′ to calculate the polarity score and trend index we mentioned above. The logistic regression model uses estimated density, twitter features and the forecasted weather factors to predict the likelihood of incidents occurring on period t′+1 in neighborhood p.  \\n FIGURE 3 POLARITY SCORE AND 3-DAY TREND OF NEIGHBORHOOD 587 FROM JANUARY 1, 2014 TO JANUARY 31, 2014 EVALUATION We evaluated our crime predictive model using Twitter sentiment analysis of January and effective weather factors by comparing its prediction to the actual theft incidents that occurred across Chicago, Illinois between December 25th, 2013 and January 30th, 2014. The Performance of logistic crime prediction model is measured by a surveillance curve.  With our training data set, we built a logistic regression to predict crime in the Chicago area. To avoid the influence of imbalanced response variable (0.07% of total response variable are crime points), we used ROSE package in R to under-sample the non-crime points [16]. For feature selection, the stepAIC backward elimination technique was used. The table below gives a summary of the information for our logistic regression model.

       " Document(page_content=\"Table I provides information on the variables that explain whether crime incidents occurred or not in every 200m*200m sector after feature selection. We can interpret our model based on the information. For instance, the coefficient of the 3-day trend indicates that for each unit increase of x3,t(p), the log-odds of theft crimes increases 1.151*10-1. Therefore, we can conclude that if there is an increasing trend of sentiment polarity, a higher crime rate could be expected. Meanwhile, in higher temperature, there is a higher chance of theft crimes, while low humidity lowers the chance of theft crimes. In spite of the prediction model being significant based on our training data, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of our crime predictive model. In our crime prediction model, the performance of our model’s prediction ability is measured by surveillance plot. The surveillance curve provides information that percentage about the actual crime captured per percentage of captured area [8]. The separated sectors in Chicago are sorted by their predicted crime density (p) from the highest density to its lowest. The function of the x coordinate and y coordinate could be written as: % Area Surveilled = x% = ==∑∑11siiniiAA         (5)  % Crime Captured = y% = ==∑∑11siiniicc         (6)  Where {An} stands for the monitored area in Chicago sorted by p; {ci} stands for actual crime with each monitored area; s stands for number of monitored area. Meanwhile, a quantified measure of prediction performance can be derived from the area under the surveillance curve (AUC). The function of AUC can be written as:  AUC = ∞−∞∫( )* '( )yA x Ad A         (7)  We applied the model to predict theft incidents during the period of January 25th, 2014 to January 31st, 2014, which contained 964 incidents that occurred within the Chicago city area. Figure 4 shows the prediction performance via surveillance plot. Our prediction model (black line) has an AUC of 0.67, which means 0.67 of the crimes are covered under the monitored area. On the other hand, the benchmark logistic regression model (dashed line), that only contains crime density variable, has an AUC of 0.66. The difference of AUC between our model and benchmark model indicate only 1.5%. However, the difference of AUCs originated from the preceding portion of % Area Surveilled. In our plot the first 40% of Area Monitored exhibited significant difference between both AUCs of our model and the benchmark model. The above surveillance plot provided about 42% of crime captured by monitoring about 20% of area in the Chicago. The difference of AUCs is small, but the result is a satisfactory performance. \\n FIGURE 4 SURVEILLANCE PLOTS USING KDE-ONLY (DASHED-LINE) AND KDE + TWITTER + WEATHER MODEL (BLACK-LINE) CONCLUSION/ FUTURE WORK This paper has presented a preliminary investigation of the use of sentimental contents in social media and weather factors for criminal incident prediction. Though a few researchers have mentioned a possible relationship between crime and sentiment, the correlation has not been seriously verified. Moreover, very few of previous works investigate the combined effect of both sentiment and weather factors on crime. Our research has filled in the gap by proving the correlation between crime and predictors of weather and sentiment. Furthermore, our evaluation results demonstrated the model’s ability to improve the forecast performance with the standard hot-spot (KDE) model on theft incidents. These results indicate not only potential benefits for the efficient allocation of policing resources but also a rewarding line for future research. There are plenty of ways to extend this work. The most direct way to improve the predicting accuracy is to obtain weather forecast data in every 6-hour time period. For now, we can only retrieve daily weather forecasts from publicly accessible resources. Moreover, once we have access to spatially differentiated weather data for each different special sector, the predictive power of our model may improve. In addition, our hypothesis for this research focused on the correlation between Twitter sentiment and crime in general. However, we did not specify the connection between Twitter contents to specific kinds of crime. By detecting the topics that are highly correlated with positive and negative opinions, we might detect the correlation between those topics with sentiment polarity and the specific criminal activities [17]. Lastly, we used logistic regression for predictive modeling. Since the coefficient of sentiment polarity is insignificant in our logistic regression model, the better alternative might be to apply support 2015 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium\\n978-1-4799-1832-4/15/$31.00 (c) 2015, IEEE 67 Authorized licensed use limited to: BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE.

Introduction\\nCrime is defined as any act that is unlawful. The existence of crime, and more impor-\\ntantly the feelings of insecurity that may stem directly from it, affects quality of life and the\\nsustainability of societies. Relevant policy and planning agendas such as the UN’s Sustainable\\nDevelopment Goals, UN Habitat’s Safer Cities Program, OECD’s well-being index [ 1] or the\\nEU’s Cohesion Reports [ 2] clearly stress the need to create urban spaces where inhabitants\\nfeel safe and secure. In that sense, it has long been established that traditional crime fighting\\nresponses are not, in themselves, enough [ 3]. Already since the 1970s, but particularly in\\nthe last two decades, policing paradigms have shifted from reaction to prevention, and from\\nanalyzing just the perpetrator and contextual social factors, to take into account urban factors\\nassociated to space, time and the generation of opportunities.\\nEnvironmental criminology principles [ 4–6] are thus based on three main ideas. First\\nthat criminal behavior is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the contextual nature of the environ-\\nment it occurs in, i.e., place matters [ 5], because it possesses individual characteristics that\\npotentiate or mitigate crime. Second, the distribution of crime patterns is not random,\\nbecause it is a consequence of such territorial conditions that vary in space and time. Third,\\nby changing the characteristics and also by channeling resources (of police, of urban design\\nor of social or cultural intervention) to these hot-spot locations, a signiﬁcant reduction in\\ninsecurity can be obtained.\\nThe proliferation of computer modelling, geographical information systems and geospa-\\ntial technologies [ 7–9] has allowed for significant advances in crime georeferencing, mapping\\nISPRS Int.

Such use of spatial data and analytics to improve performance and preven-\\ntion has been dubbed as hot-spot policing [ 10,11], place-based policing [ 12] or even forensics\\nGIS [ 13], part of what Couldren et al. [ 14] have called the new paradigm of “smart policing”,\\nwhich also urges for greater integration and knowledge sharing between police organizations\\nand research institutes, such as universities. On one hand, increasingly advanced methods as\\nSpace Syntax [ 15], as well as data mining and machine learning algorithms are being used to\\nunderstand spatial patterns and even predict occurrences, using linear methods or Bayesian\\nmodels [ 16–18]. These include, but are not limited to, random forest algorithm (RF) [ 19],\\ndecision tree [ 20,21], K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [ 22,23], support vector machine (SVM) [ 24]\\nor artificial neural networks (ANN) [ 25]. On the other, authors such as Bannister et al. [ 26]\\nhave recently cautioned for the increasing dependency of results derived from Big Data and\\nmodelling algorithms, where “causation is dead, correlation is king” [ 26] (p. 323), because\\nthey privilege “method over meaning by adopting a non-critical approach to the spatial and\\ntemporal features of the data” [ 26] (p. 323). Furthermore, it is clear from the literature that the\\nuse of these techniques is more prevalent in certain countries, whereas other countries are still\\nin the early stages of place-based policing, with a low academic and institutional culture of\\ncrime mapping or even crime georeferencing [27].\\nConsequently, these advances need to be properly framed and understood in local\\ncontexts. First, the impact that new technologies and this unprecedented capacity for\\ndata management and spatial analysis can have on evidence-based policing needs to be\\naddressed. Second, how they can go beyond computation to a more holistic contribution\\nto decision support, in line with the sharing and shifting of responsibilities promoted by\\nnew models of policing [ 28]. Third, as Andresen and Weisburd [ 12] suggest, how such\\ntheories, methods and models behave outside the locations where most of them have been\\ndeveloped and tested, namely outside larger metropolis and also in peripheral countries.\\nIn this paper, these queries are addressed in a case study in Porto, Portugal. At\\nthe western edge of Europe and recently overcoming a deep ﬁnancial crisis, Portugal is\\nconsidered one of the safest countries in the world, holding the fourth worldwide position\\nin the Global Peace Index [ 29] and presenting one of the lowest victimization rates in\\nEurope [ 30], as well as a medium-threat status [ 31]. At the same time, it presents high fear\\nof crime [ 32], something which may be reﬂected on the fact that it has one of the highest\\nrates of police ofﬁcers per inhabitant in Europe [ 33]. Furthermore, there is still a low crime\\nmapping, georeferencing and spatial analysis culture in the country [ 27] and very few\\nexamples of crime modelling using space-based algorithms exist [34–36].\\nUsing ofﬁcial registries of crime data from Porto’s Public Security Police from the\\npre-pandemic period between January 2016 to December 2018, this paper aims to contribute\\nto the current literature on geospatial crime modelling by combining spatial analysis with\\nmachine learning to create an experimental predictive model. More than the use of the\\ntechniques themselves, the production of evidence- and space-based knowledge for urban\\nsafety is deemed crucial at a time when often scarce local resources need to be properly\\nmanaged and integrated with planning and territorial agendas, catering for quality of life\\nand sustainability.\\n2. Machine Learning, Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling in Crime Hot-Spotting\\nand Prediction\\nThe recent popularity of Criminology of Place research combined with the technologi-\\ncal advances of the 21st Century, allowed for a “nascent literature of algorithmic approaches\\nto time—and place—speciﬁc crime hot spot prediction” [ 26] (p. 323), where Big Data should\\nbe recognized as “profound new instruments of social perception” [ 37] (p. 7). In the last\\nfew years this has even been more pressing. Machine learning approaches have been\\nwidely applied in different ﬁelds, such as urban science, transport and pedestrian ﬂow\\nprediction, healthcare, biology, archeology, ﬁnance and even arts [ 38,39]. They have been\\nused to monitor illegal activities [ 40,41] and to model and predict crime, with authors often\\ncomparing various methods [42–46].', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_Prediction_and_Monitoring_in_Porto_Portugal_Using_Machine_Learning_Spatial_and_Text_Analytics_5.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

[ 42], working in Taiwan, proposed a data-driven method\\nbased on the broken windows theory to predict emerging crime hotspots, improving\\nmodel performance by accumulating data with different time scales. Of all methods tested,\\ndeep learning algorithms, random forest and naïve Bayes provided better predictions.\\nFor Zhang et al. [ 43], however, the results based on the historical crime data and using\\nbuilt environment points of interests and urban road network density as co-variates to\\nimprove performance, suggested that the deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM)\\nmodel outperformed others. In another recent study on the space-time patterns of theft\\nin Manhattan, where an application prototype for searching safer parking was developed,\\nMatijosaitiene et al. [ 44] discovered that linear models performed better. Comparing\\nﬁve boroughs of New York city, Pinto et al. [ 45] also uncovered that multivariate linear\\nregression yielded a better accuracy at predicting the type of crime represented but decision\\ntrees were best at predicting the borough where the crime occurred.\\nSuch findings should imply that considering place-specific conditions, rather than univer-\\nsal computation (a one-method fits all approach), should guide the use of these algorithms. In-\\ndeed, authors have applied machine learning methods to extract knowledge and predict crime\\ndata trends with underlying place-based social, urban and economic factors. Mittal et al. [46] ,\\nfor example, used machine learning in an Indian context to predict the causality between\\ncrime rates, such as of theft, robbery and burglary, with economic indicators, observing, in\\nthat case, that unemployment was the greatest explanatory variable.\\nRecurrent as well is the integration of these models with spatial analysis using geo-\\ngraphical information systems (GIS), as a way to clarify space-time patterns, uncover spatial\\ndeterminants and overall improve the geographical hot-spot and place-based approach of\\nmodern day Criminology of Place. For example, Bogomolov et al. [ 47] used aggregated\\nbehavioral Big Data derived from mobile phones in combination with basic demographic\\ninformation, to predict if areas in London were prone to being crime hotspots or not, arriv-\\ning at an accuracy of 70%. The experiments of Zhou et al. [ 48] arrive at similar conclusions,\\nuncovering high efﬁciency and accuracy rates using a combined approach of a non-linear\\nalgorithms, gradient boost decision trees (GBDT) and GIS models, to assess the inﬂuence\\nof over one thousand factors ranging from demographic, housing, education, economy,\\nsocial and city planning. GBDT performed, in this case, better than other methods as\\nlogistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN)\\nor random forest (RF).\\nSuch area-speciﬁc crime prediction models, as Boni et al. [ 49] named them, should\\nrecognize the geographical non-homogeneity of crime patterns, something which ﬁts with\\nWeisburd’s Law of Crime Concentration [ 50]. In the case of Boni, hierarchical and multi-task\\nstatistical learning was used to predict crimes at ZIP code level, through localized models\\nwhere sparseness was mitigated by sharing information across areas. Spatial-temporal\\nprediction through the encoding of area-speciﬁc crime incidents was also applied, for\\nexample, by Zhang et al. [ 51] and Bappee et al. [ 52], showing results in compliance with\\nWeisebud’s Law. The ﬁrst used histogram-based statistical methods, discriminant analysis\\n(LDA), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), comparing patterns with neighborhood features\\nand the temporal distance to important holidays, noticing greater performance as more\\nﬁne-tuned the temporal data was. The second used hierarchical density-based spatial\\nclustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) to extract hotpoints from crime hotspots\\nfor different categories of crime, then computing a spatial distance between the cluster\\ncentroids (i.e., hotpoints of crime hotspots) as a feature for classiﬁers. In this case LR and\\nSVM displayed more accuracy than RF. Like those of spatial analysis, these area-speciﬁc and\\nspace-based results of machine learning can, to a certain extent, be displayed, interpreted\\nand shared in web GIS applications, to assist in decision support of local authorities but\\nalso citizens [53].\\nAnother point of debate is how to include non-structured data, related to perceptions,\\nroutines and overall sentiments of city dwellers. Moving beyond surveys, research has\\nincreasingly looked into mobile phone data as a proxy for activity patterns [ 47,54] but', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_Prediction_and_Monitoring_in_Porto_Portugal_Using_Machine_Learning_Spatial_and_Text_Analytics_5.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Many of these have used Twitter data\\nas a source, due to substantial use in many countries, the free availability of data and\\nthe fact that tweets are often associated to spatial and temporal coordinates [ 55–59]. In\\nthe United States, Gerber [ 55] showed how the use of Twitter data, through linguistic\\nanalysis and statistical topic modeling, improved the performance of prediction models\\nfor 19 of 25 types of crime, in comparison with a standard interpolation approach based on\\nkernel density estimation. In India, Thanh et al. [ 56] found that sentiment analysis based on\\nTwitter data led to results which matched with real crime rate data, whereas Wang et al. [ 57]\\ndisplay how a model including the automatic semantic analysis of Twitter posts combined\\nwith dimensionality reduction and prediction via linear modeling outperformed baseline\\nmodels. Using data from nearby tweets of a criminal occurrence, Siriaraya et al. [ 58] also used\\nsentiment analysis to uncover the negative characteristics of spatial areas related to different\\ncrimes, again emphasizing the relevance of a geographical baseline in such analysis.\\nContrary to sentiment analysis, not many examples are found that have used topic\\nmodelling on crime-related data [ 60,61]. This method uses statistical machine learning\\ntechniques to identify patterns (as a verbal description) in a corpus or large amount of\\nunstructured text. For example, Pandey et al. [ 60] analyzed crime reports from Los Angeles,\\nevaluating topic coherence against spatial concentration, in a test of the Law of Crime\\nConcentration. Their ﬁndings suggest that latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) generated\\ncrime-related topics with higher coherence and crime concentration, whereas non-negative\\nmatrix factorization (NMF) improved the coherence, but the spatial concentration was not\\nas high.\\nAs Bannister et al. [ 26] suggest, studies like these all have data limitations related to\\nthe representativeness of the social media data but also in connection with the accuracy of\\nthe geographical and temporal crime data used [ 62]. More research is needed into models\\nthat can cross detailed spatial analysis using GIS and ofﬁcial geo-temporal crime data, with\\nthe advances in machine learning and data-mining techniques.\\n3. Data and Methods\\n3.1. Case-Study Context\\nThe case-study of this research is the city of Porto, in Portugal. The second city in\\nthe country, after the capital Lisbon, Porto is home to around 240,000 inhabitants [ 63].\\nRecent diagnoses have placed Porto as one of the cities with the highest reported levels of\\ncriminality in Portugal, registering particularly crimes against property (e.g., auto-thefts,\\npickpocketing, robbery of buildings); against people (notably physical integrity but also\\ndomestic violence, threat or coercion); crimes against society (such as forgery or drunk\\ndriving) and miscellaneous crimes (as narcotics trafﬁc) [ 27] (p. 64). As a prime tourist\\ndestination in Europe, it is also prone to rises in non-violent street crime in the summer\\nmonths [ 31]. The total number of registered crimes per year has been decreasing somewhat\\nover the last decade in Porto (from around 16 to 14 thousand), yet the city has also lost\\ninhabitants to peripheral suburbs, leading to a more or less steady number of 65 criminal\\noccurrences per thousand inhabitants [64].\\n3.2. Data Sources\\nThe crime data used in this study are conﬁdential data purposely supplied to the\\nresearch team by the Public Safety Police of Porto, as the only publicly available crime data\\nin Portugal are the totals by municipality. This restricted and not georeferenced dataset\\nconsisted of a spread sheet, compiled by the police, containing the date, the hour, the\\ntypology, the parish and the street name of all reported crimes occurring inside the city\\nlimits between January 2016 and December 2018, amounting to around 42 thousand entries.\\nOnly 4% of data had not enough information to be georeferenced. The remainder, after\\nextensively cleaning the database (mainly street names, which were not uniﬁed), was\\ngeoreferenced by the research team at street segments, considering parish divisions.', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_Prediction_and_Monitoring_in_Porto_Portugal_Using_Machine_Learning_Spatial_and_Text_Analytics_5.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

This consisted of over 150 indicators at a city block level, related to building\\ndata (such as building type, age and type of use); dwelling data (such as size, typology,\\nconditions and occupancy); population data (such as age, gender or education); family data\\n(types, size, number of children) and employment data. Urban and land-use data were\\nretrieved either from ofﬁcial sources of Porto’s Municipality or Open Street Maps when\\nthe ﬁrst was unavailable. This includes land-use and points-of-interest; connectivity, road\\nnetwork and trafﬁc signal data; as well as the location of police stations and CCTV cameras.\\nTweets for topic modeling and sentiment analysis were extracted using Snscrape [ 65].\\nA radius of 1 km from all crime data points was considered to extract the tweets, and a\\nspeciﬁc set of terms related to crime in English and Portuguese were searched. Based on\\nthe literature analysis, a set of crime-related terms was prepared. The list consists of over\\nﬁfty crime-related terms.\\n3.3. Methodology\\nThree types of methodological procedures were used to identify the crime pattern in\\nthe city, forecast crime rates and then predict crime as occurs/does not occur. These were\\ngeospatial analysis, machine learning modeling and natural language processing (NLP).\\nFor understanding crime patterns, spatial analysis tools were applied to the dataset,\\nusing ArcGIS 10.7.1. After all datasets were merged and the ﬁnal merged dataset was\\npreprocessed and cleaned, crime entries were georeferenced considering street coordinates,\\nand then plotted with a kernel density estimation (KDE), an interpolation technique often\\nused in crime analysis, as it presents more precise results and is easily understood by\\nstakeholders [ 66,67]. Although there is not a consensus regarding which parameters to\\nuse [ 68], authors have advocated that it is a very useful methodology to describe small\\nlocal changes [ 69]. For that reason, and also catering to the smaller size of Portuguese cities,\\na cell size of 50 m was tested. This is smaller than those recently used in crime mapping\\nliterature as for example 63 m [ 67], 90 m [ 70] or 100 m [ 71], but consistent with previous\\nresearch for Portugal [ 72]. Results were validated with ofﬁcers from the Public Safety\\nPolice of Porto. Further emerging hot-spot analysis was performed [ 73], i.e., a data-mining\\ntechnique which reveals which hot and cold spots have been maintained or changed over\\nspace and time. A ﬁshnet grid was used, taking into account a larger cell size.\\nConsidering this information, a random forest algorithm was used to predict the\\nvalues of each location of a space-time cube. The tool builds two models for each location\\nin cube, and then forecasts the future time phase values. The ﬁt of the model is determined\\nby the value of the forecast root mean square error (RMSE). A “windowing” technique is\\nused, when for each location of the space-time cube two random forest regression models\\nare built. The model uses the actual and then forecasted values to forecast the values for\\nthe future time steps. The model with a smaller RMSE is selected as the best ﬁt model out\\nof two models for each location of a space-time cube.\\nAfter understanding the point pattern of registered crimes, various machine learning\\nanalysis based on supervised methods were performed to determine the inﬂuence of\\ncontextual urban, morphological and socio-economic factors. Variable selection, in order\\nto pick the most appropriate subset of predictors for the model, thus avoiding noise,\\ncomplexity and multicollinearity issues, was carried out using LASSO regression (least\\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator) [ 74]. Then, for the crime modeling, where crime\\nrates were converted into a binary target—0 if no crime occurred and 1 if at least one crime\\noccurred—four different classiﬁcation methods were applied to predict crime classes 0 “No\\nCrime Will Occur” or 1 “At Least One Crime Will Occur”. First logistic regression, where\\nthe sigmoid function is used to map the predictions to probabilities, where L-1 penalty\\nis added to perform variable selection (i.e., to select only the most important for crime\\nvariables out of a large number of initial variables), which shrinks the coefﬁcients of the\\nless contributive variables to zero. Second, decision trees, a non-parametric supervised', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_Prediction_and_Monitoring_in_Porto_Portugal_Using_Machine_Learning_Spatial_and_Text_Analytics_5.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Decision trees are applied with the “pruning” of leaves and\\nbranches responsible for classiﬁcation [ 75] to prevent tree-based model from overﬁtting.\\nOverﬁtting happens when the model learns very well patterns in the training data and\\ntherefore, demonstrates a high model performance on the training data; however, it is\\nunable to generalize the learned patterns on a new data. Third, random forest, where a\\nlarge number of individual decision trees, constructed from samples taken from the training\\nset, are considered, with each predicting a class and then an ensemble method determining\\nthe class with the most votes as the prediction of the model [ 76,77]. To build and train the\\nrandom forest model, a random split on the features is also performed, in addition to a\\nrandom selection of bootstrap samples. Fourth, support vector machine (SVM), which aims\\nto allocate hyperplanes that speciﬁcally classify data points, i.e., the ones with the greatest\\ndifference between data points in both groups [78].\\nLastly, two natural language processing methods, topic modeling and sentiment\\nanalysis, were used. The ﬁrst, through latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) [ 79], classiﬁes text\\nin a document to a particular topic. For each document d, it processes each word wand\\ncomputes p(topic t|document d), i.e., the proportion of words in document d that are\\nassigned to topic t. Then p(word w|topic t), i.e., the proportion of assignments to topic\\ntover all documents that come from the word w. On the other hand, sentiment analysis\\nmines the text to identify and extract subjective information related, for example, to positive\\nor negative sentiments [ 80]. An approach is to use machine learning and different functions\\nto construct a classiﬁer that can recognize sentimental text. Another, which does not include\\ndata training, is lexicon based and uses a variety of terms annotated by the polarity score.\\nBoth approaches can be merged into a third hybrid approach. Though, in this research,\\nthe two methods LDA and sentiment analysis are used separately as valuable additions to\\neach other.\\n4. Porto’s Crime Pattern between 2016 and 2018\\n4.1. Statistical Pattern\\nBetween 2016 and 2018, ofﬁcial police records contain a little over 42 thousand en-\\ntries, of which around 1600 (3.8%) cannot be georeferenced at street level, due to lack of\\ninformation in the registry or in the case of a crime where the victim is unable to know the\\nexact location (e.g., a wallet theft). The total amount of registered crimes has been slightly\\naugmenting, from around 13 thousand in 2016, to 14 thousand in 2017 and to around 14,500\\nin 2018. Consistent with national tendencies reported elsewhere [ 27], in Porto the most\\ncommon types of crime are crimes against heritage/property (64%; including as the main\\nsubcategories auto theft and wallet theft) and crimes against people (18%; including offense\\nagainst physical integrity , domestic violence or threats and coercion). These are followed by\\ncrimes against life in society (as drunk driving or gun trafficking) and miscellaneous crimes\\n(as drug trafficking or driving without a license); with around 8% each. Other types of crimes,\\nagainst cultural identity , against pets or against the state, account for less than 2%.\\nDuring the day (Figure 1a), crime occurrences gradually increase from 8 a.m. onward,\\npeaking between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., then gradually decreasing again, which indicates\\nthat the evenings are more crime-prone than any other time of the day. During the year\\n(Figure 1b), the number of overall registered crimes per month is relatively steady (be-\\ntween 3200 and 3700), with the highest numbers occurring between May and September,\\nsomething which corresponds to previous country assessments [ 31].

It has become consensual that data-driven methods [26; 46]\\ncontribute effectively to the reduction of (real and perceived) insecurity, and that, within\\nthese, the geographical perception of patterns is paramount [82].\\nOn one hand, crime does display concentrated and generally stable patterns over time,\\nconﬁrming for Porto the postulates of Weisburd’s Law of Crime Concentration [ 50] and\\nthe spatial principles of Environmental Criminology. The main concentration occurs in\\nthe downtown area, which is divided into persistent, consecutive but also intensifying\\nhotspot areas, whereas other smaller concentrations have also been pinpointed, including\\na new hotspot location. The forecasting of crime counts allows following this trend, by\\nshowing these axes as those with higher potential for occurrences but also uncovering other\\nlocations that may display a rising trend. Along with a temporal perception (peaks in the\\nlate afternoon, and a May–September rise) this can be very relevant in the allocation of\\nresources and in establishing prevention programs.\\nObviously, this analysis was performed using for pre-pandemic data, the only kind\\navailable at the time of writing, so crime forecasting will be performed at a later stage and\\ncompared with actual values in order to further evaluate this model’s efﬁciency. However,\\nas explained, the model was validated by using 30% of untouched data to compare to the\\nbasic reality, and it seems to ﬁt with both the expected trends and the police stakeholders’\\nviews of the territory, which have been consulted throughout this research. Additionally,\\nthe data are biased by the reporting of crime itself (not all crimes are reported), and all\\ncrimes of all typologies were considered in the forecasting and in the hotspotting, so\\nﬁne-graining the analysis by crime categories would also be of importance to cater to\\ndifferent planning and prevention necessities. As discussed by other authors [ 83], the\\ngeographical analysis of crime patterns is conditioned by the level of geography used and\\nhow the spatial crime information has been supplied, in this case only by street segments,\\nwhich have also been shown, in some locations, to perform worse than natural streets in\\nthe explanation of crime events [ 15]. Indeed, Space Syntax has often been used in crime\\nprediction and could, in future research, be used to further test or enhance the results here\\npresented. Furthermore, the visual representation of crime patterns, for example in kernel\\ndensity estimation, is also very sensitive to parameter settings, as cell size and distance band.\\nHowever, the initial iteration performed in this paper has revealed the importance of statistical\\nand spatial modeling, as it is based on know-how often not possessed by institutions, but at the\\nsame time produces results that easily connect with, are understood and can be validated by\\nstakeholders. It is proven that trans-disciplinary partnerships with universities and research\\ncenters can be the cornerstone for intelligence and place-based policing.\\nNonetheless, on the other hand, although crime mapping supported by a combina-\\ntion of geospatial and statistical analysis is essential [ 84,85], authors call for a smarter\\naggregation of data [ 86], i.e., an integrated and holistic approach that includes additional,\\nsometimes non-structured data sources reﬂecting the economic, morphological, social,\\nperceptual or cultural context of urban areas to better optimize prevention, planning and\\ncohesion policies [ 87–89]. In this research, machine learning methods, such as decision tree\\nand random forest, aligned with the Lasso regression, plotted these dimensions together\\nand revealed variables that, spatially and statistically, appear to have greater afﬁnity with\\nthe increase in reported crime rates. These include the percentage of population with low\\nlevel of schooling and the percentage of youngsters. On the contrary, places that have\\nhigher rates of population with a university degree, more CCTV and more males present in\\nthe population appear to relate less to crime rates.

Higher density, walkable neighbor-\\nhoods, a higher education and being a male are associated with lower fear of crime, whereas\\nhouse characteristics do not display an unequivocal relationship [ 90]. Street population is\\nstrongly and positively related to crime, particularly female, as is concentrated disadvan-\\ntage at the community level [ 89] and the presence of high-risk juveniles [ 91]. These studies\\nalso call attention to variables of collective efﬁcacy. This was not directly approached in\\nthis research, but the topic modeling (LDA) of the Twitter data, although these data are\\nalso restricted in terms of users, themes and size of information (and hence cannot be\\ndeemed as an overall substitute for surveys, interviews and workshops with residents)\\nwas able to provide an expedite way to make a ﬁrst iteration of how inhabitants feel about\\nthe city. As was to be expected, sentiments are mostly negative in discussing insecurity,\\nclose to the areas with higher rates of reported crime (the city center and Boavista) but also\\nareas that are highly stigmatized and command media attention (such as the Cerco social\\nneighborhood). Words such as “police”, “murder”, “injury” or “killed” reveal negative\\nsentiments in these locations, while there is a close association of areas with low crime\\nrates, such as green parks, with positive sentiments and words.\\nSuch ﬁndings clearly reveal the importance of explanatory and predictive models\\nin decision support and may steer the deﬁnition of place-speciﬁc policies but should\\nbe approached with caution. The capacity for pattern analysis is insightful and should\\ndeﬁnitely be a part of area diagnosis and monitoring. However, research should not end\\nthere, and the dependency of Big Data also hides great “dangers”, if meaning is lost [ 26].\\nFirst because correlation does not mean causality, and second, because, as discussed above,\\nsince micro-scale locations are complex urban and social systems, important variables\\nrelated to personal and perceptual issues (for example those related to collective efﬁcacy or\\ndefensible space) may be lost in computation or not computed at all. Universal algorithms\\nand methods should be replaced by a deeper modelling and spatial understanding, and\\nmodel outcomes should be the object of critique. After the identiﬁcation of hotspots, a\\nsecond stage of analysis should delve deeper into urban space, looking for the tangible and\\nthe intangible, understanding how quantifiable variables correlate at the micro-scale but\\nalso investigating the not immediately quantifiable, as community policing or CPTED teams\\nhave been doing for the recent decades. This way, spatial analysis and machine learning\\nmethods can effectively be used to properly frame these interventions, and more research and\\ndiscussion in the scientific literature is required to raise awareness, increase know-how and\\navoid the fallacy of the “model for the model” of the “model without meaning”.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Miguel Saraiva and Irina Matijošaitien ˙e; methodology,\\nMiguel Saraiva and Irina Matijošaitien ˙e; software, Miguel Saraiva, Irina Matijošaitien ˙e, Saloni Mishra\\nand Ana Amante; validation, Miguel Saraiva and Irina Matijošaitien ˙e; investigation, Miguel Saraiva,\\nIrina Matijošaitien ˙e, Saloni Mishra and Ana Amante; data curation, Miguel Saraiva, Irina Matijošai-\\ntien˙e, Saloni Mishra and Ana Amante; writing—original draft preparation, Miguel Saraiva and Saloni\\nMishra; writing—review and editing, Miguel Saraiva and Irina Matijošaitien ˙e; project administration,\\nMiguel Saraiva and Irina Matijošaitien ˙e; funding acquisition, Miguel Saraiva.

INTRODUCTION  \\nSecurity intelligence is nowadays one of the primary concerns of any country. It is an orientation of \\nsecurity techniques based on artificial intelligence that aims to collect and organize all data related to threats in \\ncyberspace [1] to detect possible attacks in real -time and focus on identifying criminal characteristics [2]. This \\nrequires deeply identifying and analyzing both patterns and trends of crime [3]. Such profiling allows relevant \\nprotection and anticipating the various incidents by earlie r detection of major attacks. In today's world, \\nindividuals, including cybercriminals, have become technically sophisticated and repeatedly expressing their \\nemotions on the web, especially on popular social media websites [4]. The internet phenomenal gro wth has led \\nmore users to express their opinions online whether in daily chat (status messages about what the user is doing), \\nconversations (tweeting to a user or group of users within a community), information sharing (posting links to \\nweb pages), or news  reporting (updates on the current case).  \\nTransfer learning has become one of the most used image classification approaches for reusing \\narchitectures and weights learned on huge datasets to enhance small and particular classification tasks [5]. A \\nsimilar  outcome may be achieved in natural language processing (NLP ) by reusing and transferring a \\nlanguage model [6]. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT ) algorithm, in \\nparticular, has been demonstrated to perform well on a variet y of English text categorization tasks, such as \\nsentiment analysis [7].

Emotions are one of the most important components of human existence that may aid in \\nthe identification of trends and user necessities.  \\nDL is a subfield of machine learning that allows machines to automatically link processes together, \\nby allowing several algorithms to be used progressively while passing from step to step, it can solve complex \\nproblems in almost the same way the human brain does. BERT is a model for learning linguistic \\nrepresentations that use the attention transformers method. A DL model designed to handle sequential data , \\nto learn the word-to-word contextual relation i n a text  [8]. \\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we discuss relevant related works. Our \\nmethodology is presented in section 3. Experiments and results are described in section 4. Finally, section 5 \\nconcludes the study and sugg ests some areas for future research . \\n \\n \\n2. RELATED WORK  \\nVentirozos et al.  [9] applied a lexicon -based approach to detect aggressive, antisocial, or \\ninappropriate behavior, within the context of the discussion. The authors employ SA at the message level, but  \\nstudy the whole communication thread using a set of n -gram, which is used for classifying the whole thread \\nas aggressive or neutral. The lexicon -based approach has the advantage to not require prior training (on a \\ndataset) to mine the data but the final r esult can differ according to the context in which the lexicons were \\ncreated.  \\nSiriaraya et al.  [10] applied the machine learning (ML) approach to create a crime -solving tool that \\ngives context for criminal events. The authors utilize data from Twitter by  providing contextual information \\nabout crime incidents occurring in a specific area (San Francisco) using machine learning classification \\nmodels ( logistic regression  and support vector machine ). The machine learning approach can adapt and \\ncreate trained m odels for specific purposes and contexts, but it has low applicability on new data because it \\nnecessitates the availability of labeled data.  \\nPereira -Kohatsu et al.  [11] applied a deep learning approach to develop a Twitter -based intelligence \\nsystem for d etecting and analyzing hate speech called HaterNet. The authors utilized a multilayer perceptron \\nneural network that accepts as input the tweet's word, emoji, and expression embeddings tokens enhanced by \\nthe tf -idf and output the area under the curve (AUC) . \\nBERT is one of the best DL algorithms in SA, as shown in [12]. Yadav et al.  [13] used the BERT \\nalgorithm to identify cyberbullying on social media platforms, utilizing the BERT model as a classifier with a \\nsingle linear neural network layer, trained and evaluated on two social media datasets, one small and one \\nfairly big.  \\nWeir et al.  [14] proposed a system that combines both machine learning and lexicon -based \\napproaches to detect terrorist web pages, gauge the strength of their content, and categorize data collected on \\nterrorism and extremism networks. The authors developed an in -depth fre quency study of the syntax using \\nthe Posit textual analysis toolkit, which included multi -word units and their related parts of speech. After \\nthat, utilizing knowledge extraction techniques, the findings are used in a knowledge extraction process \\n(decision  tree, random forest ). \\nThe above -mentioned related works can give a decent sentiment analysis prediction rate in security \\nintelligence context. However, works that use a hybrid approach of both lexicon -based and deep learning \\napproaches are rare, especially in this context. As a result, our research contributes to the above -mentioned \\nworks as an essential experimental expansion using a hybrid approach that combines both lexicon -based and \\ndeep learning approaches . \\n \\n \\n3. METHOD  \\nSentiment analysis has bee n practiced on a variety of topics like movie reviews, service and product \\nreviews, news, blogs, chatbot, and security intelligence [7]. During an extreme incident, most of the \\nmessages shared on Twitter are commentary -related, such as expressing thought s, reporting them, and \\nattempting to understand what happened and why. Sentiment analysis research has mainly focused either on \\nidentifying whether a given textual entity is objective or subjective or on identifying the polarity of subjective \\ntexts [15]. \\nOur case studies are examples of severe occurrences brought on by individual choices that had a \\nphysical impact on individuals, and therefore these events would have multiple social media \\ncommunications. Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is employed on Twitter by the means of one of the \\nfollowing techniques:  \\n− Lexicon -based (rule -based) approach: it is used to characterize the polarity (negative, positive, and \\nneutral) of textual material (words or phrases that convey the sentiment of the entire text).

By training ML algorithms with examples of labeled emotions in texts \\n(dataset), machines automatically learn how to predict sentiment without human intervention. ML \\nmodels can be trained in SA tasks to read beyond simple de finitions, and understand more complex \\nthings like context, metaphor, sarcasm, and misapplied words. The most promising algorithms are DL \\nones.  \\n− Hybrid approach: it is the combination of ML methods and lexicon -based approaches into one system to \\nenhance the  model's performance as well as sentiment scoring. This gives us a machine learning model \\nthat has been trained on a labeled corpus.  \\nOur proposed method is to use the hybrid approach to build a BERT model on a tweet’s dataset, \\nlabeled using the lexicon -based approach by following the next steps as shown in  Figure 1.  \\ni) First Step: Data collection . In this stage, data for our analysis is crawled from Twitter using Twitter \\napplication programming interface (API). We remind that the data from this social media pl atform is a \\nvaluable record of the intersubjective understanding of an extreme event by individuals and groups due \\nto the navigational ease, anonymity (the ability to post any material without disclosing names), and the \\npublication system's flaws (users on ly need to have each a valid account).  \\nii) Second Step: Enrichment . We used the Spark natural language toolkit  (NLTK ) library to break the \\nsentences into words and tagging them. After doing the parts of speech  (POS) tagging which stands for \\nPart of Speech tagging on the words of tweets, we also tagged the different words based on five \\ndictionaries that we fed into our system (positive, negative, incremental, decremental, and inverse \\nwords) each one with a different w eight.  \\niii) Third Step: Data classification . Using the above dictionary (tags), the model calculates the sentiment \\nscore of each sentence and gives the overall sentiment score. A positive score is taken as a normal tweet \\nand a negative one is taken as a crime -related tweet.  \\niv) Fourth Step: Pre -processing . Before we start building our BERT model, the acquired data is cleaned to \\nmake it ready for feeding it into the classifier.  \\nv) Fifth Step: Building the model . We load the pre -trained BERT Sequence Classifier and Token izer. \\nThen, we used the Sequence Classifier and BERT's Tokenizer, to build our model and tokenizer. \\nFinally, we used this model on the Twitter dataset that we already labeled to fine -tune the classifier.  \\nvi) Sixth Step: Evaluating the model . We assess our mode l using the test dataset by predicting sentiments \\nafter it has been built and generated.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1. Proposed method  \\n \\n \\n3.1.

Preprocessing  \\nAfter the Twitter data has been gathered and converted to text format, it must be cleaned and pr e-\\nprocessed before being utilized in sentiment analysis. Twitter data is notorious for being highly loud, with a \\nlot of banal chatter and linguistic inconsistencies [22]. To make the Twitter data as clean and easy as feasible \\nfor our sentiment analysis a lgorithm, the following preparation procedures were done.  \\n− Removal of tweets features: Tweets are frequently clogged with data that isn\\'t immediately relevant or \\nuseful for sentiment analysis. The hashtag sign (#), URLs/ hyperlinks, numbers, references to o ther \\nusers, retweet symbol (RT), and emoticons are all included in this data. While not necessarily lacking in \\nintrinsic worth, sentiment analysis algorithms do not identify this data correctly, thus it must be \\neliminated first.  \\n− Removal of repeated letters  and tweets: In tweets, words are frequently written in extended or \\nexaggerated forms (for example, “no” and “nooo!!”). To accommodate for this, the correctly spelled \\nvariant of each lengthy version of a word has been substituted. Additionally, while extra cting tweets, the \\nAPI occasionally provides identical tweets, which we removed to prevent giving a single tweet \\nexcessive weight.  \\n− Removal of stop words: we filtered the stop words using Python NLTK stop words as they are \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_prediction_using_a_hybrid_sentiment_analysis_approach_10.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Words with the distinct case would otherwise be considered as independent \\nwords and processed  accordingly.  \\nFinally, we filter our tags to have only adjectives, adverbs, and nouns as they are the most relevant \\nPOS in SA for any language [23]. \\n \\n3.3.  Building our model \\nNow that we have cleaned and prepared our data, we divide it into data X (texts) and label Y \\n(sentiments), and then into a random training subset (80%) and testing subset (20%). We built our SA model \\nusing a hybrid approach with first the lexicon -based to generate labeled output. Then, the output was fed into \\nour BERT model for  training. This model used the basic BERT model (BERT -base that consists of 12 \\ntransformer layers) and built our sentiment classifier on top of it.  \\nFor training the BERT model, we need to do some additional preprocessing:  \\n− Add special tokens to separate sen tences and do classification:  \\n\\uf0b7 [SEP]: ending of a sentence.  \\n\\uf0b7 [CLS]: start of each sentence.  \\n\\uf0b7 [PAD]: special token for padding.  \\n\\uf0b7 [UNK]: everything else (unknown token).  \\n− Pass the sequences with a constant length (padding), that we limit to 512 tokens.  \\n− Create an array of padded tokens (0  s) and real ones (1  s) called attention mask.  \\nWe trained our model on three  epochs (BERT models are already pre -trained, and a delicate fine -\\ntuning usually gives better results) with a batch size of six (the total number of traini ng samples in a batch) \\nand a learning rate of 2e -5.

Although substantial progress has bee n achieved in these areas of study, present \\ncomputational models and methods are still unable to handle these sorts of expressions.  \\nA metaphor is a figure of speech that provides a language technique for conveying thoughts and \\nnotions that are not the same  as they appear on the surface, it directly refers to one thing by mentioning \\nanother, and to efficiently identify its hidden sentiment, the model must be capable of reading between the \\nlines. In a sarcastic message, people use optimistic phrases to expres s their bad feelings. Because of this, \\nsarcasm may readily mislead SA models unless they are expressly constructed to account for it. It can be \\ndifficult to determine its sentiment without a thorough awareness of the situation, the subject, and the \\nsurroun ding environment. Cryptography focus on protecting messages (ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, \\nand integrity) by often using secret keys. It makes a message supposedly unintelligible to anyone other than \\nthose who are entitled to it, and so it is no longer possible to understand its content without more knowledge.  \\n \\n \\n5. CONCLUSION  \\nThis paper presents a crime detection and classification method based on a lexicon -based approach \\ncombined with the BERT deep learning algorithm. The classification accuracy of the method used in this \\narticle on the Twitter dataset reached 94.91%, along with 16.26% loss, 94.94% precision, 94.91% recall, and \\n94.92 F1 -score. It can be seen from the experimental results that the method used in this article can be \\neffective for crime  detection. Furthermore, it can be observed that the hybrid method based on BERT \\noutperforms existing works in crime detection.  As future works, we will detect crime using other media such \\nas audio, images, and videos based on this model.  \\n \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2022_Crime_prediction_using_a_hybrid_sentiment_analysis_approach_10.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

As shown by previous research, GPS-tagged Twitter data enables the prediction of future crimes in a major city, Chicago, Illinois, of the United States. However, existing crime prediction models that incorporate data from Twitter have limitations in describing criminal incidents due to the absence of sentiment polarity and weather factors. The addition of sentiment analysis and weather predictors to such models would deliver significant insight about how crime. Our aim is to predict the time and location in which a specific type of crime will occur. Our approach is based on sentiment analysis by applying lexicon-based methods and understanding of categorized weather data,', metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/2015_Crime_prediction_using_twitter_sentiment_and_weather_11.pdf', 'page': 0})"

      "Page content: prediction on future crime incidents. DATA COLLECTION The primary data source that we used for making a crime predictive model was Twitter data. We utilized tweets with GPS coordinates, which were generated within the Chicago city boundary from January 1st, 2014 to Jan 31st, 2014 (n=1069804). The twitter posts we used came from the official Twitter streaming API, bounded with coordinates [-87.94, 41.64] (South-West limit) and [-87.52, 42.02] (North-East limit) [9]. Figure 1 shows a kernel density estimation plot for tweets generated within the Chicago city boundary during the time period. In addition to Twitter data, Chicago criminal incidents data shows the historical trends of theft incidents occurred in Chicago. This data originated from the Chicago data portal website, which was developed by the Chicago Police Department by tracking theft incidents committed on spatial points indicated with specific latitude and longitude, and the time of the theft incidents [10].
